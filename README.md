# Long Story Short
A program I wrote to solve the puzzle Square Dance in the 2018 PEA Puzzle Hunt.

# Letter to HQ

Hey it's Tony.

So upon opening up puzzle 4.4 (Square Dance), one of the first thoughts I had was if that, if I were insane enough, I could attempt to write a program that takes each "floor" layout and tries every possible combination of boxes with the given command sequence. Later, insanity set in and, thinking this was all just for shits and giggles, Patrick and I decided to stay up for 3 hrs on call. I now sit here writing proudly to you that I have achieved what no man on my team dared to believe in.

Turns out computers are pretty fast. For each puzzle the program reached around 1000 to 2000 iterations before finding the correct solution, and each puzzle took about 2 seconds in run time solve (not counting the time it takes to input the floor layout and command sequence).

Either way, thought it'd be cool to share this with you guys. I'd like to say props to whoever made this puzzle because it's awesome. Finally, I hope you guys find my solution just as hilarious/outrageous as I currently do.
